== Description ==

Do you want to create a complex form? and with that i mean a form with many calculations, conditions and weird behaviors? If so you are in the right place. **this plugin whole objetive is to conquer those difficult forms so you have an easy time creating them** and without coding a thing.

#Here's how we help you beat down those complex forms #

## 40 Fields at your disposal (and we're just talking about the free version, the full version has even more!) ##
To cook something you need tools and the more tools you have the more dishes you can prepare. Well, for a form builder the fields are like your tools that's why we give you +40 fields and that's only the free version (the full version has even more!). And we keep creating more fields constantly. Didn't find the field you needed? Just let us know and we will create it for you.

## An spectacular calculation builder that you'll love (and yes all this is also available in the free version) ##

Creating complex form can be frustrating. The problem is that **you can fit all the form builder in one of these three categories:**

- **They offer very basic calculation support:** They can just sum up some specific "payment" fields.
- **They offer a very limited calculation builder:** You can do some basic operations (addition, multiplication etc) and if you are lucky maybe even some basic conditions
- **They straight up require you to become a developer:** They support everything that you are able to code yourself. For example, do you want to change the minimum value of a numeric field depending on a calculation? Be ready to learn how to listen to the change events of the field so you can change the attribute manually.

That's why **we crafted this plugin from the ground up to make the creation of calculations as easy as possible**, here are the main benefits you will find by using this plugin:

- **You can use any field to create a calculation:** Do you want to use the repeater or survey field to calculate a quiz result? Sure go ahead.  What about using the google maps field to calculate the distance between two points then calculate a price? Yes, that can be done too.  Date pickers, group panels every field can be used AND you don't need to learn to code.
- **You can use calculations to customize your fields too:** For example, you could use a calculation to define the minimum date of a date picker or to set the text of a html or text box.
- **Smart calculation builder:** The plugin will accompany you while you are creating your calculation and will inform you of any issue and even give you suggestions for an easy stress-free time in creating calculations.
- **And more:** Like calculations inside conditions, functions and (if you are a developer) a complete javascript and php api.

The full version has even more ways to help you in creating calculations so don't forget to check the full version features.

## A conditional logic for all your needs ##

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNGHwWdVQK4

All other plugin has conditional logic to show and hide fields but once you want to do something more complex, lets say changing the price of the options of a dropdown conditionally, you will need to use your javascript expert hat or hire a developer to do that. With AIO Forms this is not needed as every field has it's own set of conditions so you have an easy time creating your forms.


## A sophisticated style designer ##

You can create a professional looking form with your own colors and styles without coding a thing using the style designer.
